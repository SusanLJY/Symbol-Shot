  ****************** Game Rules ******************

  A 10X10 game board consisting of 100 tiles
  of 6 symbols are randomly generated in each
  game-start. 3 to 5 consecutive tiles (can be
  either horizontal or vertical) of the same
  symbol will be eliminated and the player will
  get some scores.

  To achieve this, players can swap two tiles
  by entering the positions of tiles to be
  swapped (e.g. A1 A2). 

  If the player gets 4 consecutive tiles of the
  same symbol, the whole row or column will be
  eliminated.

  If the player gets 5 consecutive tiles,
  the player gets a '!', which is a bomb and
  can destroy all tiles of a symbol when the
  player swaps the bomb with a tile containing
  that particular symbol.

  At the beginning of each level, the system 
  will give you a '!' randomly in the board.

  To win a level, the player has to reach a
  certain amount of scores within the time
  limit. If the player has already reached the 
  require score of the level, the game will stop.
  The next level will have the shorter time limit
  and a higher score requirement.

  The time limit will decrease from 60 seconds 
  and be at least 30 seconds. The score requirement
  follows a predefined function S(level)=100+50*level.
  For each swapping, score = hits * eliminated symbols.

  You can check the high achievers of highest
  current level and shortest time of each finisished
  level in [R] Record. Hope to see you there!

  Enjoy your game!
